    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); // 100 100
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); // 200, 100
    // the values of strings, numbers, and booleans go into the variable
    // if changed the original variable, won't changed the other one
 
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    // team is a reference to the original array, so if any array is changed, the original array is also changed

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99}) //  take a blank object, fold in the properties from original object, and third argument to fold in a new one
    // object.align only does one section

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
